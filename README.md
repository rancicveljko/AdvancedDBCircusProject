# CircusDB Project
This is an academic project meant for database design practice.
In this project, my team and I were to design a database meant for use in a circus, and implement it within a system of our choosing. We chose Windows Forms for its simplicity in UI design.
The implementation of the database within the system was database-first, along with basic CRUD operations to test if the connection/mapping was done correctly.
